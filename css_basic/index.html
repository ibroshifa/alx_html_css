<h1>Falling in Love with the Problem: Embrace the Challenge</h1>

  <p> <strong>Focus on understanding the problem:</strong> Rather than jumping to solutions, prioritize deeply understanding the issue you're facing. This involves 
    gathering information, analyzing different aspects, and empathizing with those affected.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Curiosity is Key: </strong>Approach problems with an inquisitive mind. Ask "why" and "how" to truly understand the root cause.</p>
 <p><strong> see challenges as opportunities:</strong> Challenges can be a chance to learn, grow, and innovate. When you view them as puzzles to solve, it can spark creativity and a sense of purpose.</p><p>
  <p><strong>Enjoy the process: </strong>Finding the solution can be just as rewarding as achieving the end goal. Embrace the journey of tackling the problem, celebrate small wins, and find satisfaction in the intellectual effort.</p>  
 <p><strong> Avoid solution bias:</strong> Don't get fixated on a particular solution too early. Falling in love with the problem allows you to explore various approaches and find the most effective one.</p>
 <strong>Research & Empathy:</strong> Immerse yourself in the problem. Talk to people affected, gather data, and understand the context.

  </p>
  <p>
   <strong> Define the Scope: </strong>Clearly define the problem you're solving. What are its boundaries and who are the stakeholders?
